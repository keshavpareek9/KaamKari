Kaamkari â€” Mobile-Only Site

Live demo: https://kaamkari.netlify.app/

About

Kaamkari is a small responsive web project built and deployed on Netlify.
Important: This site is designed and tested for mobile view only (smartphones). Desktop or large-screen layouts are intentionally limited â€” the UI, spacing and interactions assume a narrow viewport.

Mobile-Only Notice (PROMINENT)

ðŸš¨ Mobile-only: This project is intended to be used on mobile devices (portrait). For best experience use a phone or an emulator with a viewport width of â‰¤ 480px. Desktop browsers may show broken/stacked layout or simplified content by design.

cd <repo-folder>

# install (if using npm)
